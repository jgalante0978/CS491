        <p>Neurable has a vision to "create a world without limiatations." This company has provided a hardware and software solution which allows users to control the virtual world inside their HTC VIVE with only their minds. My first thought after reading Neurable's mission statement was, "Wow exactly what we've been waiting for!" Neurable describes their solution as a natural extension of our brains, creating new possiblities for human empowerment. Here is their modern take on a Brain Computer Interface.</p>

        <p>A BCI is how the hardware and software compononents of a device interact with the brain and enables cerebral activity to control said hardware and software. Neurable's BCI analyzes brain activity and uses machine learning to translate that brain activity into action.</p>
